# Backend REST API's for food recipe app

### Process to start the server:

---

Make sure that Mongo DB database is up and running.
I deployed this server on [Heroku](http://chrecipeserver.herokuapp.com). You can directly integrate in your application if needed.

1. Navigate to the `server` folder from the project root folder `recipe_app`
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm run server.js` to start the server

### Process to run tests:

---

1. Navigate to the `server` folder from the project root folder `recipe_app`
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies if not installed
3. Run `npm run test` to run test cases
